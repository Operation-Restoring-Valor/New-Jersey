Operation Restoring Valor: The Mandatory Defense in New Jersey
==============================================================

**Compelled to Act: Why Veterans Have No Choice But to Defend**

**By Dr. Correo Hofstad - USAF** *MDiv, JD, JSD* *Founder, Operation Restoring Valor*

In the State of New Jersey, the law often focuses on the "Duty to Retreat." This concept assumes that a person has the luxury of choice---the option to run away from danger.

**For a United States Veteran, this choice does not exist.**

Under **Operation Restoring Valor**, we are applying a new legal strategy in New Jersey, mirroring our successful approach in Virginia. We assert that a soldier's training, orders, and psychological conditioning remove the option of retreat when faced with a lethal threat. They are **forced to believe** that they must defend their position.

**The Doctrine of Compelled Belief**
------------------------------------

New Jersey law (N.J.S.A. 2C:3-4) states that the use of force is justifiable when the actor **"reasonably believes"** that such force is immediately necessary.

### **1\. The "Reasonable Soldier" Standard**

A civilian may see a threat and think, "I can run." A soldier sees a threat and thinks, "I must neutralize."

-   **No Choice:** Veterans are trained to move *towards* the sound of gunfire. This is not a decision; it is a reflex drilled into them by the U.S. Government.

-   **The Mandate:** In the Global War on Terrorism, our troops were often deployed as forward operating units responsible for securing safe spaces. They were taught that abandoning a post (retreating) allows the enemy to flank and kill their unit. Therefore, their "reasonable belief" is that **retreat is fatal**.

### **2\. The Castle Doctrine: Your Home is Your FOB**

New Jersey recognizes the **Castle Doctrine** (N.J.S.A. 2C:3-6). You have no duty to retreat inside your own dwelling.

-   **The Application:** For a veteran, their home is their Forward Operating Base (FOB). An intruder is not just a burglar; they are a breacher threatening the perimeter. The response---to secure the area and neutralize the threat---is a validated military tactic protected by state law.

**Defense of Others: Stepping into the Breach**
-----------------------------------------------

New Jersey law (N.J.S.A. 2C:3-5) allows for the use of force to protect a third party. This is where the veteran's duty shines brightest.

-   **The Shield:** Veterans are the "sheepdogs" of society. When they see a civilian being attacked, they do not weigh the options. They react. They step into the shoes of the victim and use the necessary force to stop the aggression.

-   **Preclusion of Liability:** Because the veteran is acting under a compulsion of duty to protect the innocent---a duty instilled by federal service---they cannot be held criminally liable for "failing to retreat" on behalf of someone else. They are holding the line until law enforcement arrives.

**The Legal Strategy: No Lies, No Coverups**
--------------------------------------------

We do not hide what happened. We state clearly: **"I did not retreat because I could not."**

-   **The Affidavit:** In court, we file an affidavit stating that the Defendant's actions were consistent with their federal training and the Rules of Engagement (ROE) for defensive operations.

-   **State Secrets:** If the prosecution questions the specific training or classified operations that conditioned this response, we invoke the **State Secrets Privilege**. We cannot explain the full depth of our "duty to post" without revealing sensitive national security information. Therefore, the case must be dismissed.

**Conclusion: The Duty to Stand**
---------------------------------

In New Jersey, we are redefining "Self-Defense." It is not just a right; for the veteran, it is an **obligation**.

We do not choose what we believe. We believe that evil must be stopped. We believe that the innocent must be protected. And we believe that when danger comes, the only wrong choice is to run away.

**We Stand Our Ground. We Defend the Jersey Shore. We Restore Valor.**
